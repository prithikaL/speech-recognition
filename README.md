# Speech-Based Gender Recognition Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify the gender of a speaker based on speech input. Using features extracted from audio data such as MFCCs, the system predicts whether the voice is male or female.

## Features
- Real-time or batch audio gender classification
- Preprocessing pipeline for noise reduction and feature extraction
- Deep neural network model (e.g., CNN or LSTM-based)
- Trained on labeled speech datasets

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place your `.wav` files in the `data/` directory
4. Run the notebook or script to train/test the model

## Dataset
Used datasets such as [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) or [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/).

## Output
Model predicts:
Input: voice_sample.wav ‚Üí Output: Female

# Speech Controlled Vehicle Automation

## Overview
This project enables vehicle movement automation using voice commands. Commands like "move forward", "stop", or "turn left" are recognized through speech recognition and converted to signals for a robotic vehicle.

## Features
- Voice command input
- Command recognition using speech-to-text
- Control of motors via microcontroller (e.g., Arduino/Raspberry Pi)
- Real-time processing with minimal delay

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SpeechRecognition library
- Arduino or Raspberry Pi
- PySerial (for serial communication)

## Hardware
- Motor driver (L298N)
- Arduino/RPi
- Microphone
- Chassis + DC Motors

## How to Run
1. Set up the vehicle and connect to your system via USB
2. Run the Python script: `python control_vehicle.py`
3. Speak commands such as:
   - ‚Äúforward‚Äù
   - ‚Äúbackward‚Äù
   - ‚Äúleft‚Äù
   - ‚Äúright‚Äù
   - ‚Äústop‚Äù

## Example
Input: "forward" ‚Üí Vehicle moves ahead

## Features
- Natural Language Processing for flexible voice commands
- Cloud integration with Google Dialogflow or Alexa Skills
- Wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
- Real-time feedback and status reporting

## Technologies Used
- Python / Node.js
- Dialogflow / Alexa SDK
- ESP32 / Raspberry Pi
- Google Speech-to-Text API

## Hardware
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Motor driver and chassis
- Microphone module
- Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module

## How to Run
1. Deploy Dialogflow agent and configure webhook
2. Upload firmware to ESP32 and connect to Wi-Fi
3. Connect your assistant (Google/Alexa)
4. Speak natural commands like:
   - ‚ÄúCan you take a left turn?‚Äù
   - ‚ÄúPlease stop now‚Äù
   - ‚ÄúGo straight for 5 seconds‚Äù
